# Progress

## What Works
- Core Memory Bank structure established with initial files: 'projectbrief.md', 'productContext.md', 'activeContext.md', and 'progress.md'.
- Basic project scope and goals documented.
- Initial documentation of architectural patterns and security practices in 'architectural_patterns.md'.

## What's Left to Build
- Expanded documentation of additional architectural patterns and security practices.
- Additional context files for complex features or integrations as needed.
- A routine process for updating Memory Bank files after project milestones or significant changes.

## Current Status
- Memory Bank setup in progress, with core files being populated.
- Initial focus on foundational documentation to ensure project continuity.

## Known Issues
- Documentation of architectural patterns and security practices is in early stages and requires further expansion.
- Lack of detailed integration or security design specifications at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Decision to prioritize Memory Bank setup to address memory reset challenges.
- Commitment to using Markdown for all documentation to maintain consistency and ease of access.
