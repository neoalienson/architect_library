# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Establishing the Memory Bank structure for the Architect Library project.
- Documenting core project information to ensure continuity across sessions.

## Recent Changes
- Created foundational Memory Bank files including 'projectbrief.md' and 'productContext.md'.
- Setting up documentation workflows to maintain project context.

## Next Steps
- Complete the creation of remaining core Memory Bank files.
- Begin documenting specific architectural patterns and security practices.
- Establish a process for updating Memory Bank files after significant project changes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- How to structure additional context files for complex features and integrations.
- Determining the frequency and triggers for Memory Bank updates.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Use Markdown for all documentation to ensure readability and ease of updates.
- Maintain a clear hierarchy in documentation to reflect project structure and priorities.
- Avoid using colons and periods in Mermaid diagram descriptions to prevent "Unsupported markdown: list" errors; use hyphens or other separators instead.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Consistent documentation is critical for project continuity given memory resets.
- A well-structured Memory Bank facilitates quick onboarding and context recovery.
